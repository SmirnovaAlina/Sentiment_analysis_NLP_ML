# Sentiment_analysis_NLP_ML Web App
<hr>
Our Web Application that takes a text(review) from user and return a prediction from 2 ML models (SVM and Naive Bayes) is the review has positive, negative or neutral sentiment. To train Machine Learning models we use amazon reviews dataset and use evaluation  metrics of Precision, Recall, F- score and Accuracy to identify the classification model which is best suited for sentimental analysis of user-input text/review. 

## Pre-processing
<hr>
In order to reduce noise of text, reduce dimensionality, and assist in the improvement of classification effectiveness we are going to use NLP techniques that includes:
Tokenization Process
Removal of  "stop  words", numbers, punctuation, downcasing

## Feature Selection
<hr>
Next we will perform the process of selecting the distinctive characteristics using TF-IDF method.
